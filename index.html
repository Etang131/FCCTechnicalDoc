          <p>
            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language
            used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations,
            clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced
            server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you
            to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files
            (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside
            a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
            connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic
            control over them.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i>Client-side</i> JavaScript extends the core language by
              supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object
              Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an
              application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user
              events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Server-side</i> JavaScript extends the core language by
              supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For
              example, server-side extensions allow an application to
              communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
              from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
              manipulations on a server.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
          <header>Variables</header>
          <p>
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
            rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
            dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0–9).
          </p>
          <p>
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
            "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well as "a" through "z" (lowercase).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
            identifiers. (For more details, see this blog post.) You can also
            use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and
            _name.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
          <header>Variable Scope</header>
          <p>
            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
            function.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
            scope. Rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
            function (or global scope) that the block resides within.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the following code will log 5, because the scope of x
            is the global context (or the function context if the code is part
            of a function). The scope of x is not limited to the immediate if
            statement block.
          </p>
          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // x is 5</code>
          <p>
            This behavior changes when using the let declaration (introduced in
            ECMAScript 2015).
          </p>
          <code
            >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
            not defined</code
          >
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
          <header>Global variables</header>
          <p>
            Global variables are in fact properties of the global object.
          </p>
          <p>
            In web pages, the global object is window, so you can set and access
            global variables using the window.variable syntax.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
            or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
            frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
            declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
            iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
          <header>Constants</header>
          <p>
            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
          </p>
          <p>
            The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as any variable
            identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign
            ($), and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
          </p>
          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
          <p>
            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
            while the script is running. It must be initialized to a value.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let
            block-scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the
            identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
          </p>
          <p>
            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
            variable in the same scope. For example:
          </p>
          <code
            >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
            WILL CAUSE AN ERROR TOO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
            //statements }</code
          >
          <p>
            However, the properties of objects assigned to constants are not
            protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
          </p>
          <code
            >const MY_OBJECT = {'key': 'value'}; MY_OBJECT.key =
            'otherValue';</code
          >
          <p>
            Also, the contents of an array are not protected, so the following
            statement is executed without problems.
          </p>
          <code
            >const MY_ARRAY = ['HTML','CSS']; MY_ARRAY.push('JAVASCRIPT');
            console.log(MY_ARRAY); //logs ['HTML','CSS','JAVASCRIPT'];</code
          >
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
          <header>Data types</header>
          <p>
            The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Seven data types that are primitives:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
              <li>
                null. A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because
                JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                NULL, or any other variant.)
              </li>
              <li>
                undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.
              </li>
              <li>
                Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or
                3.14159.
              </li>
              <li>
                BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example:
                9007199254740992n.
              </li>
              <li>
                String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value.
                For example: "Howdy"
              </li>
              <li>
                Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                unique and immutable.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <li>and Object</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Although these data types are relatively few, they enable you to
            perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
            functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You
            can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions
            as procedures that your script can perform.
